# Birding with Python and Machine Learning Slides

This repo will contain all the slides for my 2018 Pycon talk, Birding with Python and Machine Learning.

It will also contain links to the talk's video, along with any supplemental code and images.

## Supplemental Code

There are supplemental [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/burningion/birding-with-python-pycon-2018-slides/blob/master/notebooks/convolutions.ipynb) to allow you to play with the code.

You can view them in the [notebooks folder](https://github.com/burningion/birding-with-python-pycon-2018-slides/tree/master/notebooks) of this repo.
