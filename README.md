# Birding with Python and Machine Learning Slides

This repo contains all the slides for my 2018 Pycon talk, Birding with Python and Machine Learning.

It contains a link to the talk's video, along with any supplemental code and images. 

## Watch the Video

[The video is here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=938yg4udxSc).

## Viewing the Slides

The slides are all in the `slides/` directory. Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser, and you should be able to navigate through them all. 

Note they go both down and to the right.

## Supplemental Code

There are supplemental [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/burningion/birding-with-python-pycon-2018-slides/blob/master/notebooks/convolutions.ipynb) to allow you to play with the code.

You can view them in the [notebooks folder](https://github.com/burningion/birding-with-python-pycon-2018-slides/tree/master/notebooks) of this repo.
